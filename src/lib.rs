//! # A convenient alternative to the newtype pattern
//!
//! When building an API in Rust, a common dilemma is the choice between
//! type aliases and the newtype pattern.
//!
//! Consider an application-specific collection of IDs with an underlying type of `Vec<usize>`;
//!
//! Using a type alias, one may choose to define it as ```pub type Identifiers = Vec<usize>```
//! in order to provide consumers of the type with unfettered access to the underlying `Vec`
//! methods, and allow `Identifiers` to be used interchangeably with `Vec<usize>`.
//!
//! Conversely, it could also be defined via newtype as ```pub struct Identifiers(Vec<usize>)```.
//! This creates a semantically-distinct type from `Vec<usize>`, but obscures access
//! to its underlying methods.
//!
//! Creating distinct types like this is one of the strengths of Rust's type system,
//! as it allows data dependencies to be encoded at type-time instead of runtime:
//! ```
//! pub struct Identifiers(Vec<usize>);
//!
//! pub fn create_ids() -> Identifiers {
//!     Identifiers(vec![0, 1, 2, 3])
//! }
//!
//! pub fn munge_ids(ids: Identifiers) {
//!     // ...
//! }
//!
//! // Valid
//! let ids: Identifiers = create_ids(); // Known-correct IDs provided by a trusted function
//! munge_ids(ids);
//!
//! // Not valid
//! // let ids = vec![999, 6, 876]; // IDs created arbitrarily, no guarantee of correctness
//! // munge_ids(ids); // Compiler error, incorrect type
//! ```
//!
//! In some cases, obscuring access to the underlying type's methods can be
//! desirable, as it allows the available functionality to be determined
//! by the API, thus implicitly providing information about its usage
//! to the library consumer.
//!
//! However, this is not true in all cases. Collection types like `Vec` are
//! case-in-point; they have so many useful methods and trait implementations
//! that manually re-exposing each one on a newtype becomes impractical,
//! possibly resulting in an overly restrictive design.
//!
//! In these cases, the inner type can be marked as `pub`,
//! and / or certain useful access traits like [`Into`], [`Borrow`] and [`Deref`] can be implemented.
//!
//! From an API standpoint, this combines the qualities of both type aliasing
//! and newtype: The type is distinct, but provides direct access to its underlying data.
//! (Though note that this also means breaking changes to the inner type will propagate outward.)
//!
//! Usage aims to model this sub-pattern as a generalized, reusable struct with
//! intuitive implementations for standard derivable, construction and access traits.
//!
//! ## Implementation
//!
//! It does this by using two generic parameters: Type `U` to act as a tag identifying it as a
//! distinct type, and type `T` for underlying data.
//!
//! `U` is represented by a [`PhantomData`], thus decoupling its trait implementations from those of the `Usage`.
//!
//! Construction and access trait implementations are predicated on `T`, allowing the `Usage` to
//! transparently act like its underlying type in as many contexts as possible.
//!
//! ## Limitations
//!
//! Due to coherence rules, foreign traits may not be implemented for foreign types.
//! Thus, it's infeasible to implement foreign traits on `Usage`; as a library type, it's foreign by design.
//!
//! This can be worked around by implementing the foreign trait over the Usage's `T` parameter
//! , or by using a newtype that implements said trait as the `T` instead.
//!
